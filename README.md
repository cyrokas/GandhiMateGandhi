# Gandhi Mate, Gandhi

In a world ruled by tyranny, greed and bad programming puns, a lost demigod came back to save us.
Jesus, the promised one, descended from the heavens, only to find that mankind had failed him... humanity had let one evil gitHater, with the name of Donald Prompt, take over our precious lives, but Jesus could not let this go through.
He began to build a sacred, holy, godly, time-bending machine, so he could go back in time and convince our one true saviour, Gandhi, the one true activist that could save this world blinded by money and horrible java jokes.
Decades passed, and Jesus could not figure out the algorithm to bend time to his will.
After a long night, drinking wine and smoking burning bushes, it all came to him in a dream because of...  well... just because.
He took no time to start bending time, for time was short in a time like this.
He went back to the ages where any one was free, happy and could actually make funny jokes, but something went terribly wrong.
Jesus had lost control of his time-bending machine and started to enter other ages of gitHatership...  Jesus was captured by other three gitHators...  VIM Jong-il, Adolf Bitler and António $hellazar.
They made him their prisoner and then conceded to research his time machine, and found out that in the future they would all be defeated... they also found out that after them there would be another great gitHater ruling the world.
The past gitHaters immediately thought of contacting Donald Prompt, to form a powerful alliance, so they travelled back to the present, which is their future, so they could form their powerful, evil, bad punning alliance.
Jesus felt weak, he felt ashamed, he felt like he let humanity down... but then, a light shined upon him, the one true pacifist, Gandhi was there to save him.
Jesus told his story to Gandhi, and Gandhi knew he could not let this evil group get its way.
And so Gandhi focused all of his yoga power to travel to the future, so he could fight this menace, and end this evil, awful humour creating power group.
